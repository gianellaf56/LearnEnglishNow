				As the linguistic melting pot expands each and every day, many people
				experience difficulty learning English—the most spoken language in the
				United States and one of the most spoken in the entire world. And with
				busy schedules, it may be hard to meet with a tutor or class. But with
				LEN (Learn English Now), eager students learn English at their own pace,
				and at no cost! The app allows for easy access at any time of the day
				and provides supplementary quizzes and videos. After an initial
				diagnostic, users’ English background will be evaluated for a set of
				personalized game questions. And unlike other language learning programs
				and apps, LEN maintains a focus on the user’s adaptability, engagement,
				and most importantly: education. LEN goes beyond pretending or “trying”
				to learn a language—it encourages and virtually guarantees it!
